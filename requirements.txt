## üì¶ `requirements.txt`

For your script, you only need standard Python libraries (which come with Python itself), **except** for `ollama`, which is an external command-line tool (not a Python package).  
If you want to ensure a smooth Python environment (and possible future expansion), you can use this minimal `requirements.txt`:

```
# No external Python packages required for current script.
# If you use YAML parsing in the future, add: pyyaml
```

**You do NOT need to install anything via pip for this script as written.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. **Install Python (if not already)**
- Version 3.7 or above recommended.

### 2. **Install Ollama and LLaMA3 Model**
- [Ollama installation guide](https://ollama.com/download)
- After installing, run:
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3
  ```

### 3. **Install CMake and a C++ Compiler**
- On Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install cmake build-essential
  ```
- On Windows: [CMake Download](https://cmake.org/download/) and install Visual Studio or MinGW.
- On Mac:  
  ```bash
  brew install cmake
  xcode-select --install
  ```

### 4. **Directory Structure**
Your project should look like this:
```
unit-test-generator/
  run_pipeline.py
  models/
    DepartmentController.cc
  testgen/
    prompts/
      1_generate.yaml
    tests/
      # (will be created)
    build_logs/
      # (will be created)
```

### 5. **Run the Script**
```bash
python unit-test-generator/run_pipeline.py
```

## üö¶ Troubleshooting

- **Ollama not found?**  
  Make sure it's installed and in your PATH. Try `ollama --help` in your terminal.
- **CMake errors?**  
  Check your `CMakeLists.txt` and make sure all dependencies are installed.
- **Python errors?**  
  Make sure you are running Python 3 and have the directory structure as above.

**Let me know if you want a sample `CMakeLists.txt` or help with any specific error!**
